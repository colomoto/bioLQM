        <title>Description</title>
        <p>
        Perturbations are <link xref="modifiers">model modifications</link> which enable the definition of
        variants of the model by applying one or several local changes. They are widely used to describe
        mutations (often knockouts), but can also be used to define hypothetical components or interactions
        in a model.
        BioLQM supports perturbations on components or on interactions, as well as multiple perturbations.

        <title>Usage</title>

        <p>This modifier requires some configuration. The supported perturbations and the syntax of the
        parameter string to use in <link xref="cli">command line</link> or <link xref="cli">scripting</link>
        mode are described below.
        We remind that in command line, the parameter string for perturbations is given in the
        <cmd>-m perturbation:parameter</cmd>, or <cmd>-p parameter</cmd> switches.
        In scripts, it is the last argument in <code>lqm.modifyModel(model, "perturbation", parameter)</code>.
        </p>

        <p>Simple perturbations are described as <cmd>target%restriction</cmd>, where the target can be a
        component or an interaction, and the restriction is a fixed value or a range (only for components).</p>

                <title>Fix the value of a component</title>
                <p>This is the simplest type of perturbation. The function of the selected component will be
                replaced by a fixed target value.
                Use <cmd>A%v</cmd> to fix the value of component <cmd>A</cmd> to value <cmd>v</cmd>.</p>
            </item>
            
            <item>
                <title>Restrict the value of a multivalued component</title>
                <p>A slightly less restrictive perturbation,
                where the target value of a component is blocked inside a smaller range. When the target value
                of the component is larger (resp. smaller) than the range, it is replaced by the max (resp. min)
                bound of the range.
                Use <cmd>A%v1:v2</cmd> to restrict the value of component <cmd>A</cmd> in the range <cmd>[v1,v2]</cmd>.
                </p>

            <item>
                <title>Perturbation of an interaction</title>
                <p>Remove (or enforce) an interaction from the model. The function of the target component will be modified
                to always behave as if the source component had the specified value.
                Use <cmd>A:B%1</cmd> to let <cmd>B</cmd> believe that <cmd>A</cmd> is always active.</p>

            <item>
                <title>List of perturbations</title>
                <p>Define multiple individual perturbations, with a space-separated list of the above elements.
                For example <cmd>A%0 B%1</cmd> defines the double knockout of <cmd>A</cmd> and <cmd>B</cmd>.</p>
